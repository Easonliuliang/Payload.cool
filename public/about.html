    <h1>About Us</h1>
    
    <p>Payload.cool is built by developers, for developers.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We believe that developer tools should be fast, private, and easy to use. In an era where data privacy is paramount, we saw a need for a JSON formatter that doesn't require sending sensitive data to a remote server.</p>

    <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
    <p>Many online JSON tools are outdated, slow, or riddled with invasive ads and tracking. We wanted to create a modern, "cool" alternative that respects your privacy and enhances your workflow with features like Graph View and Schema Validation.</p>

    <h2>The "Cool" Series</h2>
    <p>Payload.cool is the first in a planned series of privacy-first developer utilities. Stay tuned for more!</p>
